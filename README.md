i tried to change the colors of The mondrian painting to a very vibrant color palatte something that was similar to the art created by Andy Warhol. I used the slider function to change the colors over a range of their RGB values. On hovering the mouse over the screen, the colors of the painting change with the shift in the mouse position. On adding different paintings, it had the same exagerration effect on the paintings with most of the colors shifting to a much darker shade of green and bright cyan and yellows
