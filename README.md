I tried to manipulate the Mondrian image by swapping the red and the green color pixel with the help of sliders and the transparency levels. The first slider helps in changing the value of the red pixels and the second one changes the transparency of the image. When both are shifted simultaneously, it changes the overall image color. When the first slider is all the way to the right, and the screen goes black, with the transparency being the lowest, on changing the transparency then is when these changes are seen. 
On adding different images to this code, the same color effect was observed
